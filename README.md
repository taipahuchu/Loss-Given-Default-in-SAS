**Loss Given Default for Loan Facilities**

Predicting loss given default (LGD) is playing an increasingly crucial role in quantitative credit risk modeling. In this 
project, we explore the mixed effects models to predict Loan facilities LGD, as well as other widely used LGD 
models. The empirical results show that mixed effects models are able to explain the unobservable heterogeneity and 
to make better predictions compared with linear regression and fractional response regression. All the statistical 
models are performed in SAS/STAT®, SAS® 9.2, using specifically PROC REG and PROC NLMIXED, and the 
model evaluation metrics are calculated in PROC IML. This project gives a detailed description on how to use PROC 
NLMIXED to build and estimate generalized linear models and mixed effects models.
