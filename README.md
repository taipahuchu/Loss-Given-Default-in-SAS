**Loss Given Default for Loan Facilities**

Predicting loss given default (LGD) is playing an increasingly crucial role in quantitative credit risk modeling. In this 
project, we explore the mixed effects models to predict Loan facilities LGD, as well as other widely used LGD 
models. The empirical results show that mixed effects models are able to explain the unobservable heterogeneity and 
to make better predictions compared with linear regression and fractional response regression. All the statistical 
models are performed in SAS/STATÂ®, SASÂ® 9.2, using specifically PROC REG and PROC NLMIXED, and the 
model evaluation metrics are calculated in PROC IML. This project gives a detailed description on how to use PROC 
NLMIXED to build and estimate generalized linear models and mixed effects models.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Modeling Loss Given Default in SAS/STAT
#### Loss given default (LGD) measures the percentage of all exposure at the time of default that can not be recovered.  Recovery rate (RR) is defined as one minus LGD
This project aims to fill in this gap by applying the random effect terms at multiple levels and to conduct a comparison 
study of the commonly used models in literature. We mainly investigate to apply the mixed effects models to predict 
the US corporate bonds recovery rates with the random effect terms specified at obligor, seniority and time levels. We 
find that the inclusion of an obligor-varying random effect term effectively explains the unobservable heterogeneity 
and the related predictive accuracies are also much better than the others. All the models are built up and realized in 
SAS/STATÂ® and the prediction results are generated in PROC IML.
